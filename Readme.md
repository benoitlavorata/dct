# List of docker-compose ready apps
Using docker and docker-compose is not so easy for the beginners... This is a repository of the apps I use, hopefully it can save time to others !

I only tested these scripts on ubuntu 16.04, not sure it will work for everyone. 
For windows users, do not loose your time here.


## How to use this script as a command line anywhere on your system ?
If you want to be able to run this script easily, anywhere on your system, move it to your $PATH like below:

```bash
rm install.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbglive/compose/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
rm install.sh
```

Now you can install any applications from this command:
```bash
app shadowsocks
```
